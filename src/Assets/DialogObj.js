    Fence: "Listen up, mercenary.  In honor of our ongoing partnership, I've instructed my men to keep an eye out for any salvagable gear.  They'll drop whatever found at your hideout, just keep that trigger finger calm when they show up.  All I ask in return is that you keep an eye out for my boys when you're out in the field, got it?",
    Therapist: "Hello, young man.  I have another contract for you that pays handsomely if you are interested.  Sanitar has contacted me and requested empirical data on the combat stims he has been sharing with me.  It seems he is in need of a larger data set of subjects and their reactions to a cocktail of injectors.  I thought you would be perfect  given your unique set of skills.  A batch is ready you, just make sure you inject all the stims simultaneously and note any effects when you're out in the field.  Come see me when you return for your reward.",
