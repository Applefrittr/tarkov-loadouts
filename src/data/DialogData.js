    "Hunter, I wanted to thank you on behalf of Tarkov for your work thus far.  But as the conflict drags on, more human filth emerges, killing, stealing, raping…  the citizens can only endure so much.  Sniper and I have our hands full so Tarkov needs your services once again.  I’ve a number of tasks that require your attention immediately.  Complete them and report back to me as soon as you can.  Get to it son.",
  Fence:
    "Listen up, mercenary.  In honor of our ongoing partnership, I've instructed my men to keep an eye out for any salvagable gear.  They'll drop whatever found at your hideout, just keep that trigger finger calm when they show up.  All I ask in return is that you keep an eye out for my boys when you're out in the field, got it?",
  Therapist:
    "Hello, young man.  I have another contract for you that pays handsomely if you are interested.  Sanitar has contacted me and requested empirical data on the combat stims he has been sharing with me.  It seems he is in need of a larger data set of subjects and their reactions to a cocktail of injectors.  I thought you would be perfect  given your unique set of skills.  A batch is ready you, just make sure you inject all the stims simultaneously and note any effects when you're out in the field.  Come see me when you return for your reward.",
  Skier:
    "Merc, need you ASAP.  The increase in PMC activity across the region has slowed trade to a halt and killed my business.  I've sent a couple of my guys out to scare them off but none have returned.  Fuck them, I need a professional.  There contracts ready to go for each locale in Tarkov, player's choice.  Do what you do best and deal with these bastards, okay?  I've got a few things lined up for you when you return.",
  Hideout:
    "Welcome to the Hideout.  Look around (scroll) and check for messages from local contacts.  Click Tarkov Loadouts in the navigation bar to return here.  Gear up and Escape from Tarkov! ",
